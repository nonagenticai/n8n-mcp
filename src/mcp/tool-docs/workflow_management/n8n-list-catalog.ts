    description: `Reads the Public API first. For kind: "projects", GET /projects is Enterprise-licensed; on an unlicensed instance it answers 403 (older instances 404). On that refusal, this tool falls back to n8n's official MCP server's search_projects when N8N_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN is configured (the official server lists projects regardless of the Public API's licence gate); when it is not configured, it returns just the caller's personal project, resolved the same way n8n_manage_folders resolves the 'personal' alias. If that resolution itself fails (e.g. an ambiguous or ungrafted instance), the tool returns an API_ERROR envelope with a hint instead of throwing.

teamProjectsEnabled reports the instance licence, computed per backend: on the Public API branch it is true whenever GET /projects succeeded at all — the endpoint itself is the licence gate, so a successful call means team projects are licensed even if none are visible to this API key; on the official-MCP fallback it is the official response's own teamProjectsEnabled flag when present, otherwise derived from whether any returned project is non-personal; in the personal-only fallback it is always false.

For kind: "tags", the Public API always answers — there is no fallback, since the official server's list_workflow_tags would return the same data.

An API_ERROR from the personal-only fallback (the caller\'s personal project could not be resolved) carries a hint pointing at either passing projectId explicitly or configuring N8N_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN.',
